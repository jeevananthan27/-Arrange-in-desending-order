# -Arrange-in-desending-order
Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string. 
Test Case 1: 
Input: s = "tree" 
Output: "eert" 
Explanation: 'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once. So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore ""eetr"" is also a valid answer." 
Test Case 2: 
Input: s = "cccaaa" 
Output: "aaaccc" 
Test Case 3: 
Input: s = "Aabb" 
Output: "bbAa"
